\chapter{A SAMPLE APPENDIX}

Just put in text as you would into any chapter with sections and
whatnot.  Thats the end of it.
Detailed information,lengthy derivations, raw experimental observations etc. are to be
presented in the separate appendices, which shall be numbered in Roman Capitals (e.g.
“Appendix IV”). Since reference can be drawn to published/unpublished literature in the
appendices these should precede the “ References” section.
