\noindent Learning the graph from data holds immense significance in graph-based applications. One of the major limitations of the existing graph learning methods is that they require some form of a priori information about the underlying structure present in the data, which may not be available in a variety of applications e.g., network medicine, gene regulatory networks. In such cases, structure identifiability from data becomes very crucial to create an end-to-end model. Our work proposes a novel method for graph model selection in gaussian graphical models. We solve this problem by integrating model selection and degrees of freedom with the structured graph learning algorithm \citep{kumar2019structured}. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
